# Booper
An open-source C# network chat program

## Features
With heavily unstable code, BooperGUI can do the following:
* Act as a server and client in one window
* Auto-hide with two presses on Escape.

That's about it.

## Contribution
Because this is extremely unstable, you may contribute if you would like. I'll try my best to improve it.
